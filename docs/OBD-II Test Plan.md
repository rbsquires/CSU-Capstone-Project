# Test Plan

### Introduction:

This test plan documents the testing conducted on the OBD-II Buddy application, including system and user testing. The goal is to test every aspect of my application for realiabilty and proper operation, as well as the user's experience in the app. To ensure that any bugs are found, I conducted system testing to ensure that every button that can be used gives the desired result and every view displays it's data properly. I also opened up user testing of the app and all of it's functionailty to other students. Then I offered them an opportunity to fill out a survey for OBD-II Buddy's UI/UX.

## System Testing

### Test Items:

- iPhone 14 Pro (iOS 17.1.1)
- iPad Pro (iPadOS 17.0.3)
- MacBook Pro (macOS 14.1) **Used for debugging in Xcode 15.0.1*
- iOS V-Link OBD-II BLE Adapter

### Features to be Tested:
- Check App Launch
- Check Bluetooth scanning
- Select and Pair with Bluetooth device
- Loading screen works
- App Home View
- Functionality of 
"Vehicle Info View" button
- "Back" button functionality in Vehicle Info View
- Functionality of 
"Trouble Code View" button
- "Back" button functionality in Trouble Code View
- Functionality of the
"Live Data View" button
- Current sensor data

### Approach:
I will test each component of my application listed above for proper operation. This will be done manually, both on the iPhone and iPad. For a test to pass, it must pass each test on both devices. Once all system testing passes, I will conduct user testing of the application.

### Approach:
I will allow users to test the application and it's functionality. This will be done manually, both on the iPhone and iPad. For the testing to pass, I must have no bugs or crashes during each of the user's testing. Upon condluding their testing of the application, I will have the users complete a survey of the UI/UX of the application.
